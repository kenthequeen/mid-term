## NOTE: there is no READme or javascript file for this prompt. Just answer each question below in your own words and be as thorough as possible.

1. When would you use a for loop and when would you use a for-in loop?

I would use a for loop when I want to loop through an array. I would use a for-in loop when I want to loop through an object.

2. What is an anonymous function? Why would we want to use one? An anonymous function is a function without a name that only runs once in a program. You would want to use one if you needed a function to run that would not recur. 

3. What is an IIFE, and how is it written?
IIFE stands for: Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. 
function functionName () {
	//does something
}

  if(statementhere){
	//does something
 } else {
	//does something
}


4. Why do we write tests for our code?
We write tests for our code so we can test our logic and be sure our programs behave as we've designed them to behave. 

5. What does it mean to clone a repo?
Cloning a repo is copying a repo from a master profile and saving that copy in your own bank of repositories. 

6. What is a higher order function? What is a callback?
A higher order function is a function within a function. A callback is the function that rests within a function and is an anonymous function that runs once.
